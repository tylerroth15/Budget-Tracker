# Budget-Tracker
#### Author: tylerroth15

As a user I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a internet or data connection so that my account balance is accurate no matter where travel may lead me. Offline functionality will enter deposits offline, enter expenses offline and once I connect back the internet I my account will be updated.
